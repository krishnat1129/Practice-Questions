looping in python
for iterating over an index of a list
list = [11,22,33,44,55]
if I simply use 
---
for i in list : 
     print(list(i))
---
**[Note]** index starts from 0 in python but while iterating "for" loop it iterates over value. 
It would given an index out of bound error as it would try to access list[11] (element on the 11th position) which is out of bounds as list only has 5 elements

=> Hence use "for i in range(len(list))" while looping over index of a list.
